\hspace{10pt} Na po\v{c}etku bih \v{z}eleo da se zahvalim svojim roditeljima. Ova teza je va\v{s} uspeh koliko i moj. Va\v{s}a ljubav i stalna podr\v{s}ka su mi pomogli da prebrodim \v{c}ak i najte\v{z}e trenutke. Neizmerno vam hvala! 

\hspace{10pt} I would like to express my deepest gratitude to my supervisor, Dr. Alexander Tapper, for guiding me through every step of this process. I will forever be thankful for the discussions and advice I received from you.

\hspace{10pt} I also want to thank my good friend, Dr. Olivier Davignon, for all that you have done for me (the list would be too long to write here). I'm looking forward to working with you in the future. Also, I would like to thank the H$\rightarrow$inv analysis team. Nick, Anne-Marie and Sam, thank you for all the useful chats.


\hspace{10pt} Finally, I would like to thank the Imperial College HEP group and the President's Scholarship (former Imperial College Scholarship) for giving me the opportunity to be a part of this institution and to spend two years at CERN. This is where, besides working hard on my analysis, I made friendships which have been forged in the fires of PhD studies. Dwayne, Esh, Felix, Malte, Antoni and Julia, thank you for being there to lighten up the dark times and to enjoy the good ones too.
