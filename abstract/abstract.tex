A search for invisibly decaying Higgs bosons using proton proton collision data collected by the CMS experiment at $\sqrt{s}=$~13~TeV is presented. For the first time, this search is performed using the full Run-2 dataset, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 137.2~fb$^{-1}$. 

\hspace{10pt} In 2017 and 2018, to supplement the traditional trigger strategy based on the presence of missing transverse energy, a new dedicated trigger based on the Vector Boson Fusion jet topology was introduced. Its motivation, implementation and subsequent usage is described in detail in this thesis. Its addition further enhanced the sensitivity to the Vector Boson Fusion production mechanism by allowing for a new analysis category focused around previously inaccessible event.

\hspace{10pt} A combination with the study focusing on the 2016 data is performed. No deviations from the Standard Model have been observed and the final result is reported in the form of a 95~\% Confidence Level upper limit on the Br(H$\rightarrow$inv). The overall result from the full Run-2 phase of operation is presented to be Br(H$\rightarrow$inv)~$<$~XX (XX) observed (expected). When interpreted in terms of Dark Matter searches, this result provides a leading upper limit result for sub $m_H/2$ Dark Matter candidates. Lastly, a study of projected sensitivity of this study for the conditions provided by the future upgrades of the CMS experiment is also presented.The projected limit for the total integrated luminosity of 3000 $fb^{-1}$ is placed at from the perspective of the CMS experiment at Br(H$\rightarrow$inv)~$<$~4.5 \%, while a combined result from the ATLAS and CMS experiments is expected to be Br(H$\rightarrow$inv)~$<$~2.5 \%.
