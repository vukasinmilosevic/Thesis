A search for invisibly decaying Higgs bosons in proton proton collisions at $\sqrt{s}=$~13~TeV is presented. For the first time, this search is performed using the full Run-2 dataset, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 137.2~fb$^{-1}$. In 2017 and 2018, to supplement the traditional trigger strategy based on the presence of missing transverse energy, a new dedicated trigger based on the Vector Boson Fusion jet topology was introduced. It enhances the sensitivity to the Vector Boson Fusion production mechanism. Exclusion limits are set and combined with previous measurements focusing on the 2016 era of data taking. A study of projected sensitivity of this study for the conditions provided by the future upgrades of the CMS experiment is also presented.
